         <p>Creation has no limits;let go of control.Embrace the imperfections.
        There is no such thing as
        perfect. Unlearn what is thought to be perfect.When you think too much youre removing what is moving.
          Unlearn what is thought to be creation.Everything that is created is art and that includes you.
          My name is Courtney Bailey and Im a graphic desinger and painter.I love to create art through my personal experiences in life.</p>
