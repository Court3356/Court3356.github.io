            <h3> Client-side  </h3>
            <p> Client side refers to the processes that are carreid out on the users device, typically found in the users web browser.This processes is executed after the web app has been delivered to the users device.They can include tasks such as rendering and displaying a web page</p>

            <h3> Server-side </h3>
            
            <p> Server side processing optimieses web preformance by processing and filtering data before sending it out.This processes is carried out by a web server.These processes is typically executed by the server before the website or web app is delivered to the user's device.</p>

            <p> When using preprocessing compliers such as LESS,web developers gain new features to create well designed websites.Stylesheets are constantly growing and becoming more complex.Less allows users to have more freedom by using variables,mix-ins,functions,nested variables and operators. These preprossesing compliers bring new tools to your site.</p>

            <div> LESS</div>
            <p> LESS stands for Linear Style Sheets. It is a backward compatible language extension for CSS.When installed the user can create CSS using fewer lines of code by adding in variables.LESS is a source that is open to work with all versions of CSS.
            
            </p>
            
            </div>
            
            <div>
            <div> Variables</div>
            <p> When using LESS variables ;They are designed through the use of the @,the value is then placed in a colon ":".When using this variable it reduces the number of times a value is used
            
            
            </p>
            
            
            
            </div>

                <div> Nesting</div>
                    <p>
                    Nested rules are a set of properties of the CSS that allows the properties of one class to be used for another class, following with the same name as the property.When using LESS you can class or id and store several values using style.
                    
                    </p>
                
                
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div>Mix-ins</div>
                    <p>
                    Using mix-ins in LESS is a way to complie multiple CSS properties from one rule of set to another.Simplifying it and reducing the need for multiple codes of line.With LESS you can define all the different elements using button_basic and define your information.
                        
                    </p>
                
                
                </div>
                <div>
                <div>Operators</div>
                
                <p> LESS gives arithmetic operations like subtraction,multiplication,addition and division.When the property is used it makes math equations easier. This can be applied to anything that uses numbers such as variable,numbers and colors.
                    
                    
                    </p>
                
                
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <div> Function</div>
                    <p>
                     LESS provides a variety of functions which transform colors,manipulate strings and does math.Using them is pretty simple.
